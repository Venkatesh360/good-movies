# Good Movies üï∂Ô∏è: Movie Recommendation Site
Good Movies is a movie recommendation site with a Next.js 14 frontend and a Flask backend. User data, including likes, dislikes, and recommendation details, are stored in Firebase. The backend utilises a content-based recommender system to adjust recommendations based on a user's preferences, ensuring personalized movie suggestions.

## Frontend
Movie details fetched from the TMDB API are displayed using **Flip Cards** to better utilise viewport space. Each card provides options to add the movie to the watchlist or watch the trailer for the corresponding movie. The intuitive design ensures a seamless user experience.

## Trailer Page
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>




## Watchlist
Users can maintain a watchlist to keep track of movies they plan to watch. This feature helps users organize their movie-watching schedule and ensures they don't miss any recommendations.

## Recommendations
Recommendation Cards include options to like or dislike a movie. The recommendation data is adjusted accordingly, enhancing the accuracy of future suggestions. This interactive feedback loop makes the recommendation engine more effective over time.
